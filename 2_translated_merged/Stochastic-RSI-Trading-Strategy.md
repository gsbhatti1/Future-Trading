Stochastic RSI Trading Strategy

This strategy trades based on crossover signals of the Stochastic RSI indicator.

The specific trading rules are as follows:

- Go long when Stochastic RSI crosses 30

- Go short when the Stochastic RSI crosses below 70

The strategy also includes two additional entry conditions:

- When going long, the 9-period SMA must be higher than the 21-period SMA

- When shorting, the 9-period SMA must be lower than the 21-period SMA

- Going long only signals when price is below VWAP

- Shorting only signals when price is above VWAP

This strategy uses stop loss and take profit for risk management:

- Regardless of whether you are long or short, the stop loss is set to 20ticks

- No matter long or short, the take profit is set to 25ticks

The advantage of this strategy is that it uses Stochastic RSI to identify overbought and oversold areas, and adds SMA and VWAP for filtering, which can effectively reduce false signals. However, this strategy is more suitable for trending market conditions and can easily be caught in consolidation market conditions.

||Stochastic RSI Trading Strategy

This strategy trades based on crossover signals from the Stochastic RSI indicator.

The specific entry rules are:

- Enter long when Stochastic RSI crosses above 30

- Enter short when Stochastic RSI crosses below 70

Additional entry filters:

- Longs require 9-period SMA above 21-period SMA

- Shorts require 9-period SMA below 21-period SMA

- Longs only below VWAP, shorts only above VWAP

The strategy uses stop loss and take profit for risk management:

- Stop loss set at 20 ticks for both longs and shorts

- Take profit set at 25 ticks for both longs and shorts

The key advantage is using Stochastic RSI to identify overbought/oversold regions combined with SMA and VWAP filters to reduce false signals. However, this strategy works better in trending rather than range-bound markets.
