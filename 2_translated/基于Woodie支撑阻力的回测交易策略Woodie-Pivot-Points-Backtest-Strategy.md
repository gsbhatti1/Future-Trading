Strategy Description

[trans]

## Overview

This strategy uses the Woodie model to calculate support and resistance levels and perform breakout backtesting transactions. It is a classic support-resistance breakthrough strategy.

## Strategy Principle

1. Calculate the current balance point and upper and lower rails based on yesterday's high and low closing prices.
2. When the price breaks through the equilibrium point from above, go long.
3. When the price breaks through the equilibrium point from below, go short.
4. Optional reverse trading signals.
5. Mark trading signals with different colors.

## Advantage Analysis

1. Woodie model calculation is simple and intuitive.
2. Breaking through support and resistance is a common trading technique.
3. Visualized support, resistance levels and signal markers.
4. The default parameters are simple and practical.
5. The code is easy to understand and suitable for modification and optimization.

## Risk Analysis

1. A false breakthrough after a breakout may occur.
2. Stop loss and take profit cannot be effectively set.
3. Improper model and parameter settings affect the effect.
4. Unable to distinguish between trend and consolidation.
5. The signal may not be timely.

## Optimization direction

1. Test different cycle parameters to find optimal parameters.
2. Add trend judgment indicators for filtering.
3. Add stop-loss and take-profit logic for risk control.
4. Evaluate the pullback following the breakout to generate a continuation signal.
5. Study how to judge the intensity effect of breakthroughs.
6. Consider combining with other factors for validation.

## Summary

This strategy uses the support and resistance levels of the Woodie model to trade breakouts. Optimizing parameter settings and adding stop-loss and take-profit can improve the stability of the strategy and build it into a reliable short-term trading system.

## Overview

This strategy uses the Woodie model to calculate pivots and trade breakouts for backtest. It is a classic pivot breakout strategy.

## Strategy Logic

1. Calculate current period pivot and bands using previous period high, low, and close.
2. Go long if price breaks above pivot from below.
3. Go short if price breaks below pivot from above.
4. Option to trade reverse signals.
5. Color code different trade signals.

## Advantages

1. Woodie model calculation is simple and intuitive.
2. Trading pivot breakouts is a common technique.
3. Visualized pivots and signal markings.
4. Simple and practical default parameters.
5. Code is easy to understand and modify.

## Risks

1. Risks of false breakouts after initial breakout.
2. No effective way to set stops and exits.
3. Incorrect model and parameters negatively affect performance.
4. Fails to differentiate trends and ranges.
5. Signals may not be timely.

## Enhancement

1. Test different period parameters for optimum values.
2. Add trend filter for additional validation.
3. Incorporate stop loss and take profit for risk control.
4. Assess pullbacks after breakouts for continuing signals.
5. Research ways to gauge the strength of breakouts.
6. Consider combining with other factors for confirmation.

## Conclusion

This strategy trades Woodie pivot breakouts. Optimizing parameters, adding stops and exits can improve stability for a reliable short-term system.
