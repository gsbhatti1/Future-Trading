// This is combo strategies for get a cumulative signal. 
//
// First strategy
// This System was created from the Book "How I Tripled My Money In The 
// Futures Market" by Ulf Jensen, Page 183. This is reverse type of strategies.
// The strategy buys at market, if close price is higher than the previous close 
// during 2 days and the meaning of 9-days Stochastic Slow Oscillator is lower than 50. 
// The strategy sells at market, if close price is lower than the previous close price 
// during 2 days and the meaning of 9-days Stochastic Fast Oscillator is higher than 50.
//
// Second strategy
// This is one of the techniques described by William Blau in his book
// "Momentum, Direction and Divergence" (1995). If you like to learn more,
// we advise you to read this book. His book focuses on three key aspects
// of trading: momentum, direction and divergence. Blau, who was an electrical
// engineer before becoming a trader, thoroughly examines the relationship 
// between price and momentum in step-by-step examples. From this grounding,
// he then looks at the deficiencies in other oscillators and introduces some
// innovative techniques, including a fresh twist on Stochastics. On directional 
// issues, he analyzes the intricacies of ADX and offers a unique approach to help 
// define trending and non-trending periods.
// Blau`s indicator is like usual MACD, but it plots opposite of the meaning of
// standard MACD indicator.

The provided Pine Script is designed to implement the strategy described in the document. The `Reversal123` function uses the 123 pattern to determine buy and sell signals, while the `fADX` function calculates the ADX indicator. The overall strategy combines these two methods to generate stronger trade signals.
