### Strategy Overview

This strategy is dynamically balanced with 50% of funds and 50% of positions, and risk control is achieved by constantly adjusting the proportion of positions and funds. It is suitable for investors who are unable to monitor the market in real time.

### Strategy Principles

1. The initial capital is 1 million yuan, divided into 50% funds and 50% positions.
2. During the trading cycle, at the opening of each day, if the remaining funds are greater than 1.05 times the unrealized profit and loss, 2.5% of the remaining funds will be used to increase the position.
3. If the unrealized profit or loss is greater than 1.05 times of the remaining funds, sell part of the position to restore it to a balanced state.
4. At the end of the transaction, close all positions.

### Strategic Advantages

1. Through the dynamic balance of funds and positions, risks can be effectively controlled and huge losses in extreme market conditions can be avoided to the greatest extent.
2. There is no need to frequently monitor the market. You only need to adjust the proportion of funds and positions. The operation is simple and suitable for busy investors.
3. By adjusting parameters, different levels of risk preferences can be achieved to meet the needs of different investors.

### Strategy Risk

1. Unable to capture the short-term rise and fall of the market, and the profit margin is limited.
2. If the market experiences a long-term unilateral breakthrough, the position ratio may be too low and the market cannot be fully captured.
3. Improper parameter settings may lead to too frequent position adjustments or low capital utilization.

### Strategy Optimization

1. More parameters can be introduced to achieve more refined control of positions and capital ratios.
2. You can combine the stop-loss and stop-profit principles to appropriately stop losses when the position is large.
3. You can test different trading cycle parameter settings to improve the adaptability of the strategy.

### Summary

This strategy achieves the goal of risk control through the idea of dynamic balance of funds and positions. Compared with other strategies, it is simple to operate and easy to implement. In the future, by introducing more adjustable parameters and combining other strategic ideas, the strategy can be made more perfect.

### Strategy Overview

This strategy dynamically balances between 50% funds and 50% positions to control risk. By continuously adjusting the ratio between funds and positions, it manages risk for investors who cannot monitor the market in real time.

### Strategy Logic

1. Initialize capital at 1 million, divided equally into 50% funds and 50% positions.
2. During the trading period, if remaining funds exceed unrealized profit/loss by 1.05 times at each open, use 2.5% of remaining funds to add positions.
3. If unrealized profit/loss exceeds remaining funds by 1.05 times, sell partial positions to restore balance.
4. Close all positions at end of trading period.

### Advantages

1. Effective risk control by dynamically balancing funds and positions, avoiding huge losses in extreme market conditions.
2. Simple to operate for busy investors, only need to adjust fund/position ratios.
3. Customizable parameters to meet varying risk appetites.

### Risks

1. Unable to capitalize on short-term fluctuations, profit potential limited.
2. Long one-sided run may result in insufficient position size.
3. Improper parameter tuning leads to excess position flipping or low capital utilization.

### Enhancement Opportunities

1. Introduce more parameters for finer fund/position control.
2. Incorporate stop loss/profit taking for larger positions.
3. Test different trading period parameters to improve adaptability.

### Conclusion
This strategy achieves risk control by dynamically balancing between funds and positions. Simple to implement compared to other strategies. Can be further improved by introducing more adjustable parameters and combining with other strategy concepts.
