#### Overview
This strategy is a quantitative trading system that combines G-Channel and Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The core concept is to capture market trend directions through G-Channel while using EMA for signal confirmation and risk control, aiming to generate profits from market fluctuations. The strategy operates in a fully automated mode without manual intervention.

#### Strategy Principle
The strategy operates based on two core indicators: G-Channel and EMA. G-Channel identifies price trends by dynamically calculating upper and lower bands, generating trading signals when prices break through the channel. Specifically, the strategy uses a 100-period G-Channel calculation, continuously updating the channel boundaries through mathematical formulas. Additionally, a 50-period EMA is introduced as secondary confirmation, executing trades only when the price's relative position to EMA meets expectations. Buy conditions are triggered when G-Channel signals long and closing price is below EMA, while sell conditions occur when G-Channel signals short and closing price is above EMA.

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Combines trend-following and mean-reversion characteristics, maintaining stable performance in various market conditions
2. Uses EMA as auxiliary confirmation to effectively reduce false breakout risks
3. Employs fully automated trading to avoid emotional interference
4. Features simple and clear calculation logic, easy to understand and maintain
5. Offers strong parameter adjustability to adapt to different market characteristics

#### Strategy Risks
1. May result in frequent trading in oscillating markets, increasing transaction costs
2. Improper G-Channel parameter settings may lead to signal lag
3. Inappropriate EMA period selection might miss important trend turning points
4. Possibility of significant drawdowns during extreme market volatility
Risk mitigation measures:
- Implement stop-loss mechanisms
- Optimize parameter configuration
- Add market environment filtering
- Set reasonable position management strategies

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Introduce volatility indicators to adjust strategy parameters or pause trading in high-volatility environments
2. Incorporate volume analysis to improve signal reliability
3. Add trend strength filters to avoid frequent trading in weak trend markets
4. Optimize EMA parameter adaptive mechanisms to enhance system adaptability
5. Develop multi-timeframe signal confirmation mechanisms to improve trading stability

#### Summary
This strategy constructs a robust quantitative trading system by combining G-Channel and EMA technical indicators. The strategy logic is clear, implementation is simple, and it offers good scalability. Through proper parameter optimization and risk control measures, the strategy shows potential for generating stable returns in live trading. It is recommended to optimize the strategy based on market characteristics and strictly implement risk management protocols when applying it to live trading.

It looks great, but can you add some explanation for the G-Channel calculation part in the English version? Specifically, how the `a` and `b` values are updated and their significance in the strategy?
