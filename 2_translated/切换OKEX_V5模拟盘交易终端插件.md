Strategy Description

## Trading terminal OKEX_V5 simulation disk switching plug-in

When the OKEX V5 exchange object is configured (using OKEX V5's simulated disk API KEY configuration), because the simulated disk environment is not switched, the following error will be reported:

```
{"msg":"Broker id of APIKey does not match current environment.","code":"50101"}
```

You can use this plug-in to switch, as shown in the figure:

If you want to switch back to the real disk environment, just uncheck the option and execute it again.
