Strategy Description

Pending orders will be placed at fixed intervals, and will be used as a robot to place orders as soon as new coins are listed on the exchange. Not tested due to simple logic

## Principle:

Start running after adding the trading pair, and try to obtain the market quotations without interruption. If the quotations can be obtained, it means that the transaction has started, and the strategy will place an order. If it cannot be obtained, it means that it is not open. Continue to try again and wait.
