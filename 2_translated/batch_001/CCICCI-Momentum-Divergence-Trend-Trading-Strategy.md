#### Overview

This quantitative trading strategy combines the CCI (Commodity Channel Index) or momentum indicator, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and divergence analysis to capture market trend reversal points. The strategy primarily uses zero-line crossover signals from the selected CCI or momentum indicator, combined with RSI overbought/oversold levels and potential divergence patterns to generate trading signals. This multi-indicator fusion approach aims to improve trading accuracy and reliability while reducing false signals by considering multiple market factors.

#### Strategy Principles

1. Signal Source Selection: The strategy allows users to choose either CCI or momentum as the primary signal source. This flexibility enables traders to adjust the strategy according to personal preferences or specific market conditions.

2. Crossover Signals: The strategy uses the selected indicator's (CCI or momentum) crossover with the zero line to identify potential trend changes. An upward crossover is seen as a bullish signal, while a downward crossover is considered bearish.

3. RSI Filtering: The strategy incorporates the RSI indicator to determine if the market is in overbought or oversold conditions. This helps confirm potential reversal points, increasing the reliability of trading signals.

4. Divergence Analysis: The strategy optionally considers regular divergence in RSI. Bullish divergence (price making higher lows while RSI makes lower lows) is used as additional bullish confirmation, while bearish divergence serves as bearish confirmation.

5. Entry Conditions:
   - Long: When the selected indicator crosses above the zero line, RSI is in oversold territory, and (if enabled) bullish divergence is present.
   - Short: When the selected indicator crosses below the zero line, RSI is in overbought territory, and (if enabled) bearish divergence is present.

6. Visualization: The strategy plots buy and sell signals on the chart for easy identification of trading opportunities.

7. Alerts: The strategy sets up conditional alerts to notify traders when buy or sell signals are generated.

#### Strategy Advantages

1. Multi-Indicator Fusion: By combining CCI/momentum, RSI, and divergence analysis, the strategy provides a comprehensive market perspective, helping to reduce false signals and improve trading accuracy.

2. Flexibility: Allowing users to choose between CCI and momentum as the primary signal source enables the strategy to adapt to different market environments and trading styles.

3. Trend Identification: Utilizing zero-line crossover signals effectively captures potential trend changes, helping traders enter positions in a timely manner.

4. Filtering Mechanism: Using RSI overbought/oversold levels as a filter helps avoid unfavorable trades in extreme market conditions.

5. Divergence Confirmation: Optional divergence analysis provides additional confirmation for trading signals, enhancing the strategy's reliability.

6. Visualization and Alerts: Through signal markers on the chart and alert functionality, traders can easily identify and track trading opportunities.

7. Parameterization: Key parameters of the strategy (such as indicator lengths, RSI thresholds) are adjustable, allowing traders to optimize according to specific needs.

#### Strategy Risks

1. False Signal Risk: Despite employing multiple confirmation mechanisms, the strategy may still generate false signals in highly volatile markets, leading to unnecessary trades.

2. Lagging Nature: The indicators used all
