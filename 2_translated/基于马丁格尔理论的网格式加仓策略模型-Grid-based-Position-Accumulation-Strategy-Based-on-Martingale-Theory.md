#### Overview
This strategy is a grid-based position accumulation model based on Martingale theory, which balances costs by dynamically adjusting position sizes during price declines. The core strategy involves increasing positions when price drops by 8%, with each new position being twice the size of the previous one, while setting a 5% profit target. This strategy is particularly suitable for capturing price regression opportunities in oscillating markets.

#### Strategy Principle
The strategy employs several key technical indicators and parameter settings:
1. Drop Monitoring: Uses 15 candlesticks as the lookback period to measure price decline by comparing the current price to the highest price
2. Position Accumulation Mechanism: Triggers position increase when price drops 8%, doubling the size each time
3. Cost Calculation: Dynamically calculates the weighted average cost through cumulative cost and quantity
4. Take Profit Condition: Automatically closes the position when the price rises to 105% of the average cost
5. Risk Control Mechanism: Sets a maximum number of position accumulations to 10, forcing a position closure after exceeding

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Cost Balancing: Quickly reduces average cost through exponential position increase, improving profit probability
2. Controllable Risk: Sets a maximum accumulation number to avoid infinite position trapping
3. Automatic Execution: Clear strategy logic suitable for automated trading systems
4. Stable Returns: Excellent performance in oscillating markets, capable of continuous small stable returns
5. Strong Adaptability: Parameters can be flexibly adjusted according to market conditions

#### Strategy Risks
1. Capital Requirement: Exponential position increase requires large capital reserves
2. Drawdown Risk: Continuous downtrend may lead to significant drawdowns
3. Execution Risk: High-frequency trading may face slippage and fee impacts
4. System Risk: Drastic market fluctuations may trigger frequent trades
Solutions:
- Set a reasonable initial position and capital ratio
- Add trend filters to avoid counter-trend trading
- Optimize trading frequency and fee control
- Improve risk control mechanism, enhance market volatility monitoring

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Dynamic Parameter Adjustment:
- Automatically adjust the drop threshold based on market volatility
- Adjust the accumulation multiplier based on volume changes
2. Trend Filtering:
- Add trend indicators to avoid counter-trend operations in strong trends
- Optimize entry timing through multi-timeframe analysis
3. Risk Control Improvement:
- Add drawdown limits and total position control
- Implement volatility-based dynamic stop loss
4. Trading Optimization:
- Optimize order execution strategy to reduce slippage
- Implement intelligent position management

#### Summary
This strategy combines Martingale theory with grid trading to create a highly adaptive trading system. The strategy performs excellently in oscillating markets and can achieve stable returns through scientific position management and risk control. However, attention must be paid to capital management and market environment compatibility when using it, and thorough backtesting is recommended before live implementation.
