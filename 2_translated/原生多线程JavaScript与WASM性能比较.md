Native multi-threaded JavaScript and WASM performance comparison

Strategy Description


The inventor quantitatively tried to make Javascript support real multi-threading from the native low-level, and added the WASM function. Below is a DEMO. Download the latest host to try it out.
This function is not a Worker function of Javascript. It can be used to communicate with each other within multiple threads or with the main thread.

C language to wasm can generate tests from this website: https://wasdk.github.io/WasmFiddle/

The C language code compiled into wasm is as follows

```c
int fib(int f) {
    if (f < 2) return f;
    return fib(f - 1) + fib(f - 2);
}
```

After compilation, download the wasm file and convert it to a hex string using python
```python
python -c "print('data:hex,'+bytes.hex(open('program.wasm','rb').read()))"
```

Just replace the content behind the variable in the code

> __Thread(function, arguments...)

Create a thread and return the thread tid. The functions of the accepted thread body function must complete all function codes within the thread function. References to other closure functions are not supported. All APIs of the platform can be called within the thread, but other user-defined functions cannot be called.

Simple example:
```javascript
let tid = __Thread(function(x, y) {
    return x + y
}, 1, 2)
Log(__threadJoin(tid))
```

Example of multi-threaded request:
```javascript
function main() {
    let threads = [
        "https://www.baidu.com",
        "https://www.163.com"
    ].map(function(url) {
        return __Thread(function(url) {
            Log("GET", url)
            return HttpQuery(url)
        }, url)
    })
    threads.forEach(function(tid) {
        Log(__threadJoin(tid))
    })
}
```

> Thread local storage variables

Supports thread local storage variables. To facilitate data sharing, the data is valid when the thread is not terminated by `__threadJoin` waiting for exit success or `__threadTerminate`.

```javascript
__threadGetData(tid, key)
__threadSetData(tid, key, value)
```

If tid is 0, it means the current thread. If value is not specified, it means deleting the key. It supports mutual access of shared variables between threads. The value must be a serializable variable.

> Thread communication

```javascript
__threadPostMessage(tid, msg) //Send a message to the specified thread. When tid is 0, it is sent to the main thread, that is, the current main function. Call the reply message to the main thread within the thread. The message can be captured by EventLoop.
__threadPeekMessage(tid, timeout) // Receive messages from the specified thread. If timeout (milliseconds) is not specified, it will wait forever. If tid is 0, it means waiting for messages from the main thread.
```

> __threadJoin(tid, timeout)

Wait for the thread to end. Specify timeout (milliseconds) to specify the waiting timeout. You can not specify it, just wait until the thread ends. Successfully returns a structure containing the function return value and recycles resources. The structure is as follows
```javascript
{
    id: tid, // Thread id
    elapsed: 1111, // Thread running time (nanoseconds)
    terminated: false, // Whether the thread is forcibly terminated
    ret: 123, // Return value of thread function
}
```
If timeout returns undefined

> __threadTerminate(tid)

Forcefully end the thread and recycle resources (you can no longer use __threadJoin to wait for the end)

> Note

The __Thread function does not support referencing variables outside the function (running as an isolated environment). Referring to external variables will cause compilation failure.

```javascript
function main() {
    let cycle = 100
    let input = 30
    let threads = [
        __Thread(function(cycle, input) {
            function fib(f) {
                if (f < 2) return f
                return fib(f - 1) + fib(f - 2)
            }
            let ret = 0
            for (let i = 0; i < cycle; i++) {
                ret = fib(input);
                Log("javascript progress: ", i)
            }
            return 'javascript fib: ' + ret
        }, cycle, input),

        __Thread(function(cycle, input) {
            let data ='data:hex,0061736d010000000186808080000160017f017f0382808080000100048480808000017000000583808080000100010681808080000007908080800002066d656d6f727902000366696200000aa480808000019e80808000000240200041024e0d0020000f0b2000417f6a10002000417e6a10006a0b'
            let m = wasm.parseModule(data)

            let instance = wasm.buildInstance(m, {
                stack_size: 65 * 1024 * 1024,
            })

            let ret = 0
            for (let i = 0; i < cycle; i++) {
                ret = instance.callFunction('fib', input)
                Log("wasm progress: ", i)
            }

            return 'wasmfib: ' + ret
        }, cycle, input)
    ]

    threads.forEach(function(tid) {
        let info = __threadJoin(tid)
        Log('#'+tid, info.ret, 'elapsed:', info.elapsed / 1e6, "#ff0000")
    })
}
