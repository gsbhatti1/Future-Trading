Strategy Description


[trans]
Five sell and nine buy strategy

This trading strategy simply follows the old trading adage "Sell in May, Buy in September" to generate trading signals.

Specifically, it determines when to open long positions and close positions based solely on the day and month. When the month enters September, open long positions; when the month enters May, close all long positions.

The advantage of this method of deciding strategic position adjustment by switching months is that it is very simple and easy to implement and does not require complex technical analysis and calculations. But its disadvantages are also obvious:

Firstly, fixed monthly trading completely ignores the actual market conditions and cannot be flexibly adjusted according to market conditions. You may close your position prematurely to take profits in a bull market, or you may miss a timely stop loss in a bear market.

Secondly, flexible fund management cannot be achieved in fixed months. It is impossible to evaluate whether a position needs to be increased or decreased based on the specific circumstances of each transaction.

Finally, the cost of slippage is not considered. In actual operation, frequent opening and closing of positions on a monthly basis will generate more transaction cost friction.

Generally speaking, this simple and fixed "five sells and nine buys" strategy has a certain entertainment nature and should not be used in real transactions. Traders need to establish a systematic trading system in order to gain a foothold in the market.

This trading strategy simply follows the classic market saying “Sell in May, buy in September” to generate trade signals.

Specifically, it only uses the month to determine when to enter longs and when to close all positions. Longs are entered when the month switches to September, and all longs are closed when it becomes May.

The advantage of using fixed months for position switching is that it’s very simple and straightforward, with no need for complex technical analysis and calculations. But the disadvantages are also obvious:

Firstly, fixed month trading completely ignores actual market conditions and cannot flexibly adjust based on price action. It may exit profitable positions prematurely during bull markets, or fail to cut losses in time during bear markets.

Secondly, fixed months cannot achieve flexible capital management. It is unable to evaluate whether to add or reduce positions based on each specific trade.

Finally, it does not consider slippage costs. Frequent monthly opening and closing will incur relatively more trading friction costs.

In summary, this simple fixed “Sell in May, Buy in September” strategy has some entertainment value, but is not suitable for live trading. Traders need to establish systematic trading frameworks to survive in the markets.
