#### Overview

This strategy aims to solve the problem of being unable to set leverage during Pine script backtesting and achieve leverage compound interest. The strategy dynamically calculates the opening lot number by calculating the strategy equity, the set leverage multiple, and the closing price.

#### Strategy Principles

1. Set the precision and control the accuracy of the opening lot size.
2. Set the leverage multiple, the default is 1 times.
3. Calculate the opening lot size: `Lev = math.max(math.round(strategy.equity * leverage / close), 0)`, making it proportional to equity and leverage.
4. Entry: go long when the RSI indicator breaks through 30 from the low; go short when it breaks through 70 from the high.
5. Place an order according to the calculated lot size Lev.

#### Advantage Analysis

1. Solve the problem that Pine script cannot set leverage.
2. The change in equity is proportional to the number of positions opened, achieving leverage compound interest.
3. RSI indicator filtered to avoid unnecessary transactions.
4. The accuracy of lot calculation is adjustable to meet different needs.

#### Risk Analysis

1. If the leverage is too high, the position may be liquidated.
2. Leverage and opening lot size need to be appropriately adjusted to control risks.

#### Optimization Direction

1. Can test stability under different parameters.
2. Can be combined with stop loss strategy to further control risks.
3. Multi-factor models can be considered to improve strategy effects.

#### Summary

This strategy implements leverage settings in the Pine script, solves the problem of backtesting being unable to simulate leverage, calculates the number of open positions and links them to equity, and completes leverage compound interest. The strategy is simple and effective, can be further optimized, and is worth learning.

#### Overview

This strategy aims to solve the problem that Pine Script cannot set leverage during backtesting to achieve compound interest with leverage. The strategy dynamically calculates the position size based on the strategy equity, set leverage ratio, and closing price.

#### Strategy Logic

1. Set precision to control the precision of position size.
2. Set leverage ratio leverage, default is 1x.
3. Calculate position size: `Lev = math.max(math.round(strategy.equity * leverage / close), 0)`, making it proportional to equity and leverage.
4. Entry signal: long when RSI breaks above 30 from below; short when RSI breaks below 70 from above.
5. Place order with calculated size Lev.

#### Advantage Analysis

1. Solve the problem that Pine Script cannot set leverage.
2. Position size changes proportionally with equity changes, achieving compound interest with leverage.
3. RSI filtered to avoid unnecessary trades.
4. Precision is adjustable to meet different requirements.

#### Risk Analysis

1. Excessive leverage can easily cause liquidation.
2. Need to adjust leverage and position size properly to control risk.

#### Optimization Direction

1. Can test stability under different parameters.
2. Can incorporate stop loss to further control risk.
3. Can consider multi-factor model to improve strategy performance.

#### Summary

This strategy implements leverage setting in Pine Script, solving the problem that backtesting cannot simulate leverage, calculates position size linked to equity to achieve compound interest with leverage. The strategy is simple and effective, can be further optimized, and worth learning.
