Triple-High-Price-Volume-Breakout-Strategy

> Strategy Description

This strategy predicts whether there will be a gap breakthrough opportunity the next day by judging whether price and trading volume form a triple higher high in the late trading period. It is a typical high-frequency trading strategy.

Strategy principle:

1. Calculate the relationship between the high points of three consecutive K lines of price and determine whether there are triple higher high points.

2. Calculate the relationship between three consecutive K-lines of trading volume and determine whether the trading volume has expanded.

3. Determine whether the closing prices all close the Yang line, showing strong characteristics.

4. During the critical period of late trading, if the above condition is met, it is predicted that a gap breakthrough may occur the next day.

5. Carry out high-leverage operations and seek to cash out and take profits during the opening period after the gap.

Advantages of this strategy:

1. Triple high point price and volume judgments can improve the accuracy of forecasts.

2. Operations during key periods can enlarge profit potential.

3. The profit-taking time is fixed, eliminating decision-making difficulties.

Risks of this strategy:

1. The prediction is only based on simple K-line patterns and is easily trapped by reversals.

2. High-leverage operations are extremely risky, and fund management is particularly critical.

3. There is no way to limit the size of the loss, and there is a possibility of a huge retracement.

In short, this strategy attempts to predict the next day's market through the late trading pattern, and on the premise of clarifying the risk of retracement, can obtain a certain probability of high-leverage profit opportunities. But investors still need to be very cautious.
