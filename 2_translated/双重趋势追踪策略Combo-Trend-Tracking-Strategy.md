// Second strategy
// This technique was described by William Blau in his book "Momentum,
// Direction and Divergence" (1995). His book focuses on three key aspects 
// of trading: momentum, direction and divergence. Blau, who was an electrical 
// engineer before becoming a trader, thoroughly examines the relationship between 
// price and momentum in step-by-step examples. From this grounding, he then looks 
// at the deficiencies in other oscillators and introduces some innovative techniques, 
// including a fresh twist on Stochastics. On directional issues, he analyzes the 
// intricacies of ADX and offers a unique approach to help define trending and 
// non-trending periods.
