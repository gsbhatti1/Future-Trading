## Overview

This strategy is a relatively simple low-profit strategy that mainly uses Renko bricks and TEMA indicators to identify trends and conduct reversal trades. The strategy logic is simple and intuitive, and stable returns can be obtained through parameter optimization.

## Strategy Principle

1. Use Renko bricks instead of K lines to identify price trends more clearly.
2. The TEMA indicator has a smaller delay than the EMA and can capture trend turning points early.
3. Go long when TEMA crosses above the short-term SMA, and close when it crosses below. Renko bricks make crossing more reliable.
4. When the price is higher than the long-term SMA, do not chase the increase and avoid overweight positions.
5. Set a profit-taking condition, and the position will be closed only when the minimum profit requirement is met.

## Advantage Analysis

1. The combination of Renko bricks and TEMA indicators is simple and effective.
2. Clearly identify trends and avoid repeated conflicting transactions.
3. TEMA reduces delays and allows for more timely entry.
4. Use reasonable stop-profit and stop-loss measures to control risks.
5. Suitable for high-frequency small capital transactions.

## Risk Analysis

1. Unable to re-accumulate positions in time, making it difficult to make sustained profits.
2. Improper parameter setting may miss trading opportunities.
3. Unable to control one-way positions, there is a risk of expanding losses.
4. It is difficult to obtain sufficient profits and is more suitable for small arbitrage.

## Optimization Direction

1. Optimize SMA and TEMA parameters to find the best combination.
2. Test different take-profit conditions to balance returns and risks.
3. Add a limit on the number of positions opened to control one-way positions.
4. Set stop loss points based on volatility indicators.
5. Evaluate and cooperate with other strategies to achieve profit amplification.

## Summary

This strategy uses Renko bricks and TEMA indicators to determine the trend, which is simple and effective. It is suitable for high-frequency small capital arbitrage, but the room for expanding profits is limited. The effect can be improved through parameter optimization and risk control methods, and it can also be tried to be used in conjunction with other strategies, which has a lot of room for improvement.

## Overview

This is a relatively simple micro-profit strategy that mainly uses Renko boxes and TEMA indicator to identify trends for reversal trading. The logic is straightforward and can generate steady profits through parameter optimization.

## Strategy Logic

1. Use Renko boxes instead of candles to more clearly identify price moves.
2. TEMA has less lag compared to EMA, allowing earlier detection of trend changes.
3. Go long when TEMA crosses above short-term SMA, and close position when TEMA crosses below SMA. Renko boxes make the crossover more reliable.
4. Avoid buying when price is above long-term SMA to avoid oversized positions.
5. Set take profit criteria to only close position when meeting minimum profit target.

## Advantage Analysis

1. Renko and TEMA combo is simple yet effective.
2. Clear trend identification avoids conflicting whipsaw trades.
3. TEMA reduces lag for more timely entries.
4. Reasonable stop loss and take profit controls risks.
5. Suitable for high-frequency small capital trading.

## Risk Analysis

1. Hard to quickly re-accumulate position, limiting profit potential.
2. Improper parameters may miss trading opportunities.
3. No control over position size in one direction, risks amplified losses.
4. Hard to achieve adequate profits, more suited for small scalping.

## Improvement Directions

1. Optimize SMA and TEMA parameters to find best combo.
2. Test different take profit criteria to balance profitability and risk.
3. Add open count limits to control one-way position size.
4. Incorporate volatility indicators to set stop loss.
5. Evaluate combining with other strategies for profit amplification.

## Summary

The strategy effectively identifies trends with Renko and TEMA, suitable for high-frequency small capital scalping, but has limited potential to amplify profits. It can be improved via parameter optimization and risk control means, or combining with other strategies, leaving large room for enhancements.
