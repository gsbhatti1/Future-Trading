#### Overview
This strategy is a dynamic trend following system that combines Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) with the Relative Strength Index (RSI). It identifies trend direction through 9-period and 21-period EMA crossovers, using RSI as a trend confirmation indicator. The strategy includes a comprehensive money management system, including dynamic stop-loss and profit target settings.

#### Strategy Principles
The core logic is based on several key elements:
1. Using short-term (9-period) and long-term (21-period) EMA crossovers to capture trend changes.
2. Confirming trends with 14-period RSI, requiring RSI > 50 for going long and RSI < 50 for going short.
3. Implementing fixed-point stop-losses (default 30 points), with dynamic position sizing based on risk amount.
4. Calculating profit targets dynamically using money management parameters.
5. Displaying real-time entry markers, target prices, and stop-loss levels on the chart.

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Combines trend and momentum indicators for improved signal reliability.
2. Complete money management system adaptable to account size.
3. Clear visual feedback system including trade failure markers.
4. Fully customizable parameters to suit different trading styles.
5. Automated entry and exit execution reducing manual intervention.

#### Strategy Risks
1. EMA as a lagging indicator may generate delayed signals in volatile markets.
2. Frequent false breakout signals possible in ranging markets.
3. Fixed-point stop-losses may lack flexibility during volatility changes.
4. Careful parameter adjustment needed for different market conditions.
5. Potential slippage risks in low liquidity environments.

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Introduce adaptive stop-loss mechanisms, such as ATR-based dynamic stops.
2. Add market volatility filters to adjust strategy parameters during high volatility periods.
3. Implement trading time filters to avoid unfavorable periods.
4. Develop smarter position sizing systems considering market volatility.
5. Incorporate additional indicators to filter false signals.

#### Summary
This strategy establishes a complete trend following system by combining EMA crossovers with RSI confirmation. Its main strength lies in the organic integration of technical analysis and risk management, offering good scalability and adaptability. While inherent risks exist, through continuous optimization and parameter adjustment, the strategy can provide traders with a robust trading framework.
