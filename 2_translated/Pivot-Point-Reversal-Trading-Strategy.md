## Overview

This strategy realizes trend following trading by identifying price reversals in the pivot area to form signals. Buying during an upward trend and selling during a downward trend aims to capture larger market trends.

## Strategy Principle

1. Calculate the pivot point using the highs and lows of the previous n periods.
2. When the price rises and breaks through the upper pivot point and then falls, a buy signal is generated.
3. When the price falls, breaks through the lower pivot point and then rises, a sell signal is generated.
4. The breakthrough of the pivot point determines the trend reversal, and the reversal verification forms a trading signal.
5. Set stop loss levels to control risk.

## Advantage Analysis

1. A reversal in the fulcrum area has a high probability of generating a larger market trend.
2. Breakthrough verification effectively filters out false breakouts.
3. Easy to adapt to different varieties through parameter adjustment.
4. The stop loss setting is reasonable and single loss can be controlled.
5. The transaction logic is simple and intuitive, making it easier to operate in real time.

## Risk Analysis

1. The fulcrum parameters must be properly grasped to avoid missing trading opportunities.
2. Inability to distinguish between normal shocks and trend reversals.
3. There is no way to limit the number of one-way tracking, and there is a risk of loss amplification.
4. Without setting a profit stop point, profits cannot be locked.

## Optimization direction

1. Test the effects of different fulcrum parameters on different varieties.
2. Increase the authenticity of indicators in judging breakthroughs.
3. Set a take profit or trailing take profit to lock in profits.
4. Evaluate the strength of the fulcrum and avoid opening a position in the opposite direction.
5. Limit the maximum number of one-way reversal tracking.
6. Optimize fund management strategies and adjust positions.

## Summary

This strategy forms a trading signal by identifying the reversal of the fulcrum area. The framework is simple and reasonable, and can be optimized and improved by itself. Indicator application can be appropriately expanded and the entry filtering conditions can be enriched. Take-profit and risk control mechanisms also need to be added to improve stability. Overall, this strategy has great room for improvement.

## Overview

This strategy identifies price reversals around pivot point areas to generate signals for trend trading. It buys on pullbacks in uptrend and sells on bounces in downtrend, aiming to ride significant moves.

## Strategy Logic

1. Calculate pivot points using high/low of previous n bars.
2. When price breaks above upper pivot point then drops, buy signal is generated.
3. When price breaks below lower pivot point then rebounds, sell signal is generated.
4. Pivot point break judges trend reversal, and reversal confirmation forms trade signals.
5. Set stop loss to control risks.

## Advantage Analysis

1. High probability of significant moves when reversal occurs around pivot areas.
2. Breakout confirmation filters out false breakouts effectively.
3. Easy to adjust parameters for different products.
4. Reasonable stop loss controls single trade loss.
5. Simple and intuitive logic, relatively easy to implement for live trading.

## Risk Analysis

1. Need to properly determine pivot parameters to avoid missing opportunities.
2. Unable to distinguish normal oscillations and trend reversals.
3. No limit on number of consecutive trades, risks amplified losses.
4. No profit defined, unable to lock in profits.

## Improvement Directions

1. Test different pivot parameters on different products.
2. Add indicators to judge the authenticity of breakouts.
3. Define take profit or trailing stop to lock in profits.
4. Assess pivot point strength to avoid premature reverse entries.
5. Limit maximum number of consecutive reversal trades.
6. Optimize capital management for better position sizing.

## Summary

This strategy identifies trading opportunities from pivot area reversals with a simple and reasonable framework. It has large room for custom optimization and improvements. Some expansions on indicator applications can enrich entry filters. Profit taking and risk control mechanisms are also needed to improve stability. Overall, this strategy has good potential for enhancements.
