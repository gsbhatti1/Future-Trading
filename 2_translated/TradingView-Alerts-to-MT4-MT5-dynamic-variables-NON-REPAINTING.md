> Strategy Description

Accidentally, I’m sharing an open-source profitable Forex strategy. This was aimed to be purely educational material. A few days ago, TradingView released a very powerful feature allowing dynamic values from PineScript to be passed in Alerts, which can now be instantly executed in the MT4 or MT5 platform of any broker in the world. Thanks to TradingConnector, these dynamic values enable executing trades with pre-calculated stop-loss and take-profit levels as well as stop and limit orders.

Another fresh feature of TradingConnector is the ability to close positions partially—provided that the broker allows it, of course. Detailed specifications for alerts syntax and functionalities can be found at the TradingConnector website. How to include dynamic variables in alert messages can be seen at the very end of the script in `alertcondition()` calls.

The strategy also takes commission into consideration.

Slippage is intentionally set to 0 due to the near-instantaneous delivery time provided by TradingConnector, especially if you’re using a VPS server hosted in the same datacenter as your brokers’ servers. I am using such an setup; it is feasible. Small slippage and spread are already included in the commission value.

This strategy is NON-REPAINTING and uses NO TRAILING-STOP or any other feature known to be faulty in TradingView backtester. Does this make the strategy bulletproof and 100% success-guaranteed? Absolutely not! Remember, no matter how profitable a script appears on backtesting, it only tells about past performance. There is zero guarantee that the same strategy will produce similar results in the future.

To turn this script into a study so that alerts can be produced, do the following:
1. Comment out the "strategy" line at the beginning and uncomment the "study" line.
2. Comment out lines 54-59 and uncomment lines 62-65.

Then add the script to the chart and configure alerts.

This script was built for educational purposes only.

Certainly, this is not financial advice. Anyone using this script or any of its parts should be aware of the high risks associated with trading.
